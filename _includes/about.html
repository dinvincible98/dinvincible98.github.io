                    <p class="large text-muted">I recently graduated from University of California, Irvine with a bachelor degree in mechanical engineering. During my undergraduate years, I learned various areas in mechanical engineering such as thermaldynamics, mechanical design, fluidmechanics, control and etc. I also conducted in developing a medical device which I was responsible for mechanical design. I wish to strength my ability to integrate mechanical, electrical and programming skills so I decide to dig in robotics field. Currently, I am pursuing a master degree of robotics in Northwestern University. My interest includes motion control, SLAM, artificial Intelligence, machine learning and motion planning.</p>
