intro: Brief Description
description: This is the final project for course MAE 172 Robot Design at UC Irvine. This is a customized project from the scratch and fulfills the course requirement. 
sub: Motivation
description2: 1.Many games need card shuffling are popular<br>2.Cards shuffled by hand are easy to be curved<br>3.No product with acceptable price for family market<br>4.Card dealing by hand takes a lot of time and makes errors.
sub2: Design description
description3: The mechanism of this design is very straightforward. In the beginning, the user turns on the machine then the rack and pinion elevator will lift the poker case approximately 55mm up. Next, the user put one deck of poker into the case. While IR sensors detect cards, two rollers connected to motors on the poker case begin to roll in opposite directions until after the IR sensor detects there are no cards in the poker case continuously 12 times. After distributing cards onto the left and right platform, the elevator goes down and motors beneath two platforms start working and drive cards back to the poker case. When all cards are dispensed back to the poker case, the elevator rises to the highest point and shakes 0.5 seconds to the cards to make them into a deck so the user can easily remove cards. When all cards are removed and IR sensors detect nothing, the elevator goes down to the original position. One complete shuffling process takes approximately 50 seconds. Moreover, we have a switch for the purple LED lights, which can make the shuffler look cool at night and users can play cards in the dark.<br> For more detailed explanation, please view my github page below.
