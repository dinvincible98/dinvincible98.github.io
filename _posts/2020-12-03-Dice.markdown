intro: Brief Description
description: This is a default final project "Jack/Dice in the box" for ME314 Machine Dynamics at Northwestern University. The goal of this project is to simulate a dice bouncing inside of a moving box as shown in the demo.
sub: Modeling System
description2: In this project, the system contains two bodies:A dice and a box.The dice has a length of 1, mass of 1 and box has a length of 6, mass of 6.Both bodies have rotational inertia equals 1(Assuming the center of the mass is the center of the geometry).The dice has a configuration(x_dice, y_dice, theta_dice) and the box has a configuration(x_box, y_box, theta_box).The system involves 3 frames:world_frame, box_frame and dice_frame.And there are two external forces apply to the box in x and y direction which cause the box to move along a trajectory.The dice falls from the center of the box and should experience several impacts with the box.Also, the dice is contrainted to the inner area of the box and the moving trajectory of the box should not affect by the dice.
sub2: Technical Outline
description3: 1. Draw a diagram to show the transformation of frame.<br>2. Calculate all the transformation of frame.<br>3. Calculate Lagrangian, Eular-Lagrange equations with the existence of external forces and constraints.<br>4. Wirte function for updating impact equations<br>5. Modify simulation function and run simulation<br>6. Plot the trajectory of dice/box versus time.<br>For more detailed information and explanation, please visit my github page below.
