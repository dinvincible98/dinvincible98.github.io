intro: Brief Description
description: This is the final project for the cource ME 449 Robotic Manipulation at Northwestern University. It is also the capstone project for the course "Modern Robotics" on Cousera.The goal of the project is to wirte a program that enables KUKA youBot to finish a pick and place task in V-Rep simulation scene.
sub: Procedures for motion planning
description2: 1. Plan a trajectory as desired trajectory for the end-effector to follow <br>2. Use the previous desired trajectory in feedfoward+PI to calculate the kinematics of the youBot<br>3. Use the calculated kinematics to drive the youBot <br>4. Save the result as a .csv file and conduct simulation in V-rep scene 6.<br> For more detailed information, please visit my github page.
